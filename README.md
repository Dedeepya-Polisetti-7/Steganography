# 🔐 Securing Website Using IDS, IPS, and Steganography

## 📌 Description

This project enhances web application security by integrating three major techniques: Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and Steganography.

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Uses **Statistical Anomaly Detection** to monitor real-time user behavior such as clicks and keypresses. It raises alerts when abnormal patterns are detected, identifying potential threats early.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Implements **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** to validate login credentials and restrict unauthorized access to secure pages, strengthening the authentication system.
- **Steganography**: Utilizes the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** algorithm to embed sensitive data (like passwords) within image files, providing an additional encrypted layer of security. The embedded data can be securely extracted by authorized users.

By combining these three approaches, this project provides a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework for web applications.
